# KMeans-clustering

This repository demonstrates K-Means clustering using the `sklearn` library in Python. The project includes an implementation of the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.


## Dataset
We use the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species:

* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica
Each sample has four features:

* Sepal length
* Sepal width
* Petal length
* Petal width
